Take HCQ with Zinc, Take 5,000 mgs of C and D for a week, go vegan, use peroxide therapy. It&#39;s just a damn cold!!! We don&#39;t need a vaccines... they don&#39;t work on toxic poisoning. Why is everyone in charge lying???   \n",

Skeptical about this whole thing and I dont need a vaccine because I'm healthy. For some people with immune deficiencies, it might be worth considering, but like I said, not mandated, and not rushed. Not required. Hope that makes sense   \n",

When are they going to address this problem. It is like they are prisoners because they don&#39;t want to sign papers saying they don&#39;t want to stay in their state. <a href=\"https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2020/07/kentucky-couple-placed-house-arrest-ankle-bracelets-refusing-sign-coronavirus-quarantine-pledge-video/\">https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2020/07/kentucky-couple-placed-house-arrest-ankle-bracelets-refusing-sign-coronavirus-quarantine-pledge-video/</a> Senator Rand was the first Senator to be diagnosed with asymptomatic covid -19 clear back in March.

Now that is no longer a concern, why are we still having lockdowns?   \n",

We don’t need another vaccine, or masks! We need herd immunity!! Our body’s have a built in immunity, this is why babies crawl on the floor and put things in their mouth. Vaccines only introduce more foreign substances and chemicals that are gonna make things worse. God made our bodies unique and if we let the body produce a herd immunity it will work.. more people die of the flu every year than we know. Since covid19 is a corona virus and the tests have been contaminated. Masks don’t work! Fauci and Birx said so in the very beginning but now they are required, why? Have you ever read the label on cloth masks? Mine I bought from Kohl’s says it will NOT PROTECT FROM COVID19!!! Yet I have to wear it into grocery stores, pharmacies, ER’s... WHY??

It is a WRONG for them to call COVID-19, \"the virus\" or \"the coronavirus\", it is COVID-19, . . . OR . . . it is NOT! COVID-19 IS NOT THE SAME as coronavirus! COVID-19 is allegedly CAUSED by one of many coronaviruses. *Simply put, . . . if anyone has ever experienced a common cold, they are likely to test positive for COVID-19, when tested.* “Some” truth about COVID-19 from the CDC.gov website, as of 18 July 2020. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/serology-overview.html COVID-19 TESTING -PLEASE READ THE BELOW, VERY CAREFULLY, and focus on the words they used, such as; *\"you may have\"* and *\"the virus that causes COVID-19,\"* and *\"there is a chance\"* and *\"with a virus from the same family of viruses,\"* and *\"as the one that causes the common cold.\"* *“What do your results mean?* If you test positive • A positive test result shows you may have antibodies from an infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. However, there is a chance a positive result means that you have antibodies from an infection with a virus from the same family of viruses (called coronaviruses), such as the one that causes the common cold.”   \n",

So very sick of all the lies and liars! It is a WRONG for them to call COVID-19, \"the virus\" or \"the coronavirus\", it is COVID-19, . . . OR . . . it is NOT! COVID-19 IS NOT THE SAME as coronavirus! COVID-19 is allegedly CAUSED by one of many coronaviruses. *Simply put, . . . if anyone has ever experienced a common cold, they are likely to test positive for COVID-19, when tested.* “Some” truth about COVID-19 from the CDC.gov website, as of 18 July 2020. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/serology-overview.html COVID-19 TESTING -PLEASE READ THE BELOW, VERY CAREFULLY, and focus on the words they used, such as; *\"you may have\"* and *\"the virus that causes COVID-19,\"* and *\"there is a chance\"* and *\"with a virus from the same family of viruses,\"* and *\"as the one that causes the common cold.\"* *“What do your results mean?* If you test positive • A positive test result shows you may have antibodies from an infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. However, there is a chance a positive result means that you have antibodies from an infection with a virus from the same family of viruses (called coronaviruses), such as the one that causes the common cold.”   \n",

I am so very sick of all the lies and liars! It is a WRONG for them to call COVID-19, \"the virus\" or \"the coronavirus\", it is COVID-19, . . . OR . . . it is NOT! COVID-19 IS NOT THE SAME as coronavirus! COVID-19 is allegedly CAUSED by one of many coronaviruses. *Simply put, . . . if anyone has ever experienced a common cold, they are likely to test positive for COVID-19, when tested.* “Some” truth about COVID-19 from the CDC.gov website, as of 18 July 2020. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/serology-overview.html COVID-19 TESTING -PLEASE READ THE BELOW, VERY CAREFULLY, and focus on the words they used, such as; *\"you may have\"* and *\"the virus that causes COVID-19,\"* and *\"there is a chance\"* and *\"with a virus from the same family of viruses,\"* and *\"as the one that causes the common cold.\"* *“What do your results mean?* If you test positive • A positive test result shows you may have antibodies from an infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. However, there is a chance a positive result means that you have antibodies from an infection with a virus from the same family of viruses (called coronaviruses), such as the one that causes the common cold.”   \n",

So very sick of all the lies and liars! It is a WRONG for them to call COVID-19, \"the virus\" or \"the coronavirus\", it is COVID-19, . . . OR . . . it is NOT! COVID-19 IS NOT THE SAME as coronavirus! COVID-19 is allegedly CAUSED by one of many coronaviruses. *Simply put, . . . if anyone has ever experienced a common cold, they are likely to test positive for COVID-19, when tested.* “Some” truth about COVID-19 from the CDC.gov website, as of 18 July 2020. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/serology-overview.html COVID-19 TESTING -PLEASE READ THE BELOW, VERY CAREFULLY, and focus on the words they used, such as; *\"you may have\"* and *\"the virus that causes COVID-19,\"* and *\"there is a chance\"* and *\"with a virus from the same family of viruses,\"* and *\"as the one that causes the common cold.\"* *“What do your results mean?* If you test positive • A positive test result shows you may have antibodies from an infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. However, there is a chance a positive result means that you have antibodies from an infection with a virus from the same family of viruses (called coronaviruses), such as the one that causes the common cold.”   \n",

New York is actually something as difficult when it comes to prevent spreading of a virus like Covid-19 as one of the worlds biggest transition centers. To someones information even Norway has within one nursing home for elders had a deathrate of 50%, and more then half of the victims here so far were situated in nursing homes, so unless Cuomo&#39;s patients died during transport, while there was nothing more to do for them in the hospital then what was done where they were situated allready, and as beds were sparse and the patients too many, in other words &quot;easy as that&quot;, then someone is calling for a very strange use of resources while infectionrates and deathrates are high enough to still require a pshycological climate allowing coopration also states betweens. I&#39;ve earlier been impressed with Rand Paul&#39;s argumentation, which has contained sound thoughts based on broad sets of knowledge to at times form both inspirational and uplifting ideas. What happened? Has unreasonableness become the new name of the game?   \n",

Who will fight a tyrannical government, upon which they rely to keep their families from starving to death?   \n",

Take HCQ with Zinc, Take 5,000 mgs\\nof C and D for a week, go vegan, use peroxide therapy. It's just a damn\\ncold!!! We don't need a vaccines... they don't work on toxic poisoning.

Skeptical about this whole thing and I\\ndont need a vaccine because I'm healthy. For some people with immune\\ndeficiencies, it might be worth considering, but like I said, not mandated,\\nand not rushed. Not required. Hope that makes sense\\n\\n   \n",

We don’t need another vaccine, or masks!\\nWe need herd immunity!! Our body’s have a built in immunity, this is why\\nbabies crawl on the floor and put things in their mouth. Vaccines only\\nintroduce more foreign substances and chemicals that are gonna make things\\nworse. God made our bodies unique and if we let the body produce a herd\\nimmunity it will work.. more people die of the flu every year than we know.\\nSince covid19 is a corona virus and the tests have been contaminated.

COVID-19 IS NOT THE SAME as coronavirus! COVID-19 is allegedly CAUSED\\nby one of many coronaviruses. *Simply put, . . . if anyone has ever\\nexperienced a common cold, they are likely to test positive for COVID-19, when\\ntested.* “Some” truth about COVID-19 from the CDC.gov website, as of 18 July\\n2020. \\nCOVID-19 TESTING -PLEASE READ THE BELOW, VERY CAREFULLY, and focus on the\\nwords they used, such as; *\"you may have\"* and *\"the virus that causes\\nCOVID-19,\"* and *\"there is a chance\"* and *\"with a virus from the same family\\nof viruses,\"* and *\"as the one that causes the common cold.\"* *“What do your\\nresults mean?* If you test positive • A positive test result shows you may\\nhave antibodies from an infection with the virus that causes COVID-19.\\nHowever, there is a chance a positive result means that you have antibodies\\nfrom an infection with a virus from the same family of viruses (called\\ncoronaviruses), such as the one that causes the common cold.”\\n\\n   \n",

New\\nYork is actually something as difficult when it comes to prevent spreading of\\na virus like Covid-19 as one of the worlds biggest transition centers. To\\nsomeones information even Norway has within one nursing home for elders had a\\ndeathrate of 50%, and more then half of the victims here so far were situated\\nin nursing homes, so unless Cuomo's patients died during transport, while\\nthere was nothing more to do for them in the hospital then what was done where\\nthey were situated allready, and as beds were sparse and the patients too\\nmany, in other words \"easy as that\", then someone is calling for a very\\nstrange use of resources while infectionrates and deathrates are high enough\\nto still require a pshycological climate allowing coopration also states\\nbetweens. I've earlier been impressed with Rand Paul's argumentation, which\\nhas contained sound thoughts based on broad sets of knowledge to at times form\\nboth inspirational and uplifting ideas. What happened? Has unreasonableness\\nbecome the new name of the game?\\n\\n   \n",
